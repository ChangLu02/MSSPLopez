In first part of the analysis, we will find whether there is correlation between r_pb and item difficulty.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
df <- readxl::read_xlsx("MAMS and Dental Combined for Analysis.xlsx")
```

```{r, results='hide', echo=FALSE}
df_students <- df[2:32, ]

head(df_students)
# Define the new column names for the questions
question_names <- paste0("Q", 1:20)  # Generates Q1, Q2, ..., Q20

# Rename only the question columns
colnames(df_students)[2:21] <- question_names

head(df_students)

```

```{r}
# Compute item difficulty as the mean proportion of correct responses
item_difficulty <- df_students %>%
  summarise(across(Q1:Q20, ~ mean(as.numeric(.), na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = everything(), names_to = "Item", values_to = "Item_Difficulty")

print(item_difficulty)
```
```{r}
# Compute point biserial correlation for each question using Pearson correlation
point_biserial <- map_df(paste0("Q", 1:20), function(q) {
  cor_value <- cor.test(as.numeric(df_students[[q]]), as.numeric(df_students$`Total Score`), method = "pearson")$estimate
  tibble(Item = q, Point_Biserial_Correlation = cor_value)
})

print(point_biserial)
```

The r_pb I calculated is equal to the original data client provided. Also,we can notice that there are some negative rpb, which suggests that students who performed well overall tended to get that specific question wrong more often than those who performed poorly.

Now we move to figure out correlation between them:

```{r}
# Combine item difficulty and point biserial correlation data
combined_IDPB <- left_join(item_difficulty, point_biserial, by = "Item")

print(combined_IDPB)
```

1. Pearson Correlation
```{r}
correlation_result <- cor(combined_IDPB$Item_Difficulty, 
                          combined_IDPB$Point_Biserial_Correlation, 
                          use = "complete.obs")

print(paste("Pearson Correlation coef between Item Difficulty and Point Biserial Correlation:", round(correlation_result, 3)))
```

```{r}
ggplot(combined_IDPB, aes(x = Item_Difficulty, y = Point_Biserial_Correlation)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "red") +
  labs(title = "Relationship Between Item Difficulty and Point Biserial Correlation",
       x = "Item Difficulty",
       y = "Point Biserial Correlation")
```

A Pearson correlation of 0.423 indicates a moderate positive relationship between item difficulty and point biserial correlation, which suggests that easier questions (higher item difficulty, >=0.8) tend to better discriminate between high and low performance students(higher point biserial correlation). But some outliers exist.

2. Spearman's Rank correlation
```{r}
spearman_corr <- cor(combined_IDPB$Item_Difficulty, 
                     combined_IDPB$Point_Biserial_Correlation, 
                     method = "spearman", use = "complete.obs")
print(paste("Spearman's Rank Correlation coef:", round(spearman_corr, 3)))
```

3. Kendall Tau correlation
```{r}
kendall_corr <- cor(combined_IDPB$Item_Difficulty, 
                    combined_IDPB$Point_Biserial_Correlation, 
                     method = "kendall")

print(paste("Kendall Correlation coef:", round(kendall_corr, 3)))
```

The relationship is weak to moderate (0.423 Pearson, 0.361 Spearman, 0.244 Kendall).
In a word, some easy questions do have higher discrimination power. However, not all easy questions discriminate well, and medium-difficulty questions (0.4-0.6) tend to be the best discriminators.

```{r}
#Combine the number of flaws into the data set
Flaws <- readxl::read_xlsx("Final Item Flaw Scores 2025.xlsx")
flaws <- c(0, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 1, 5, 3, 5)
item_difficulty$Flaws <- flaws
head(item_difficulty)
spearman_corr <- cor(item_difficulty$Flaws, item_difficulty$Item_Difficulty, method = "spearman")
print(spearman_corr)
```

```{r}
point_biserial$Flaws <- flaws
spearman_corr1 <- cor(point_biserial$Flaws, point_biserial$Point_Biserial_Correlation, method = "spearman")
print(spearman_corr1)
```
```{r}
item_difficulty$point_biserial <- point_biserial$Point_Biserial_Correlation
spearman_corr2 <- cor(item_difficulty$Item_Difficulty, item_difficulty$point_biserial, method = "spearman")
print(spearman_corr2)
```
